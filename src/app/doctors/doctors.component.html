        <p>There has been an indisputable rise in the number of Venetians suffering mental breakdown following the advent of the Rent in the Sky. It is widely accepted across
             the city that the unnatural phenomenon preys upon the mind, as does the sleeplessness and tension brought about by the change in the cityâ€™s inhabitants. What 
             only a relative few understand is that there exists a direct correlation between the new influx of magic and the affect on the human mind.
                The link between madness and magic was not always the main concern of the doctors that work in the Ospedale San Servolo, but since the Rent in the Sky tore
                 apart the heavens it has become their sole focus.</p>

                 <p>Doctors of the Ospedale</p>
                 <p>Founded in 1753 on the island of San Servola, an island where one can dig through centuries of history, the Ospedale is home to the Doctors and their experiements. 
                     Originally founded as a mental hospital to house and treat the mentally unstable of Venice. However almost as soon as it opened, the institution was hitting finacial problems
                    as the government of Venice lost interest in the project. In time the aristocracy realised that the Doctors could be of great use to them. They made donations to the Ospedalein 
                in return for taking unwanted family memebers in. Soon the Ospedale was filled with bastard children, wanted criminals and wealthy familiy memebers made to dissapear.  </p>

                <p>Originally the Ospedale was true to their mission to treat and care for the insane, using the best practices known at the time they treated and cared for those interred at the 
                    hospital. Students came from all over the world to study, for a fee of course. Over time the experiemnts and treatments started to incorporate techniques never before
                    seen, some even steeped in mysticism. It wasn;t long before these studies lead to the realm of magic, and the Ospedale changed from a place to treat the mentally ill
                    into a place to study magic and it's link to madness.
                </p>

                <p>This study almost inevitable lead to what can only be described as torture, the inmates, including the former head of the Ospedale, tortured daily under the pretense of
                    research. All pretense of finding a cure for the mentally ill was abandoned, their 'research' becoming the Ospedales first and only goal. They found that pain, sadness and 
                    suffering increased an individuals ability to percieve and their susceptibility to the forces controlling nature and the world around them. The Doctors continued their 
                    experiments to harness this power for themselves. 
                </p>
                <p>When the rent opened, the doctors were split between their experiments and treating the citizens of Venice, their once feared masks even becoming a symbol of hope to some
                    citizens as sickness grabbed them. It was at this time that the Doctors finall discovered that they could store the power the insane could see and feel int ehir torment. 
                    This power could be captured and stored within special gem like crystals implanted within the afflicted and used by the Doctors. 
                </p>

                <p>In the years since the rent opened the Doctors have grown and developed their ability to generate and store this power, though to do so they need fresh subjects to torture and
                    use every day. Therefore the Doctors are out at night, hoping to catch new subjects, the lonely stranger, the wandering visitor and the homeless can all end up taken buy the Doctors, 
                    locked in the Ospedale and tortured for what is left of their lives. Once almost dead, their bodies used to become Lab Assistants, or Carrion. During the day they are benevolant, 
                    heading into the city to treat and tend to the sick, but this is just a chance to scout for that nights victims. Even the Wardens are no more than brain washed slaves following the 
                    Doctors orders mindlessly and with unfailing loyalty. 
                </p>
                <P>The Doctors are stretching their reach far and wide, developing weapons to sell around the world, transforming animals into mindless killing machines and of course continuing
                    their research into the link between madness and magic, and creating new ways to increase the suffering of these individuals for better rewards.  </P>

                <p>The Doctors are a mix of Doctors, staff of the Ospedale, Madmen and modified animals. Doctors use magic for a lot of their attacks and can leech will
                    points from the madmen to cast their magical abilities. Their monstrous animals, freakish creations from animals of our world provide dangerous close 
                combat potential. Each Doctor provides a different danger to opposing gangs, from strong magical abilities to devestating firepower.  </p>
