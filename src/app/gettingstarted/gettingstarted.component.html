    <p>The year is 1795, A great Rent has torn open reality and sunk most of Europe beneath the waves. Only one place stands untouched by the calamity: Venice.</p>

    <p>By day the city bustles, the Queen of the Adriatic taking pride of place once again as the West's capital of trade. However, by night Venice takes on a darker persona, 
      both figuratively and literally masking itself. Gangs stalk the canals looking for blood, the clandestine secret societies making themselves known, fighting to carve 
      out their own territories.</p>

    <p>But more sinister still, the Rent in the Sky has opened the path for otherworldly phenomena. Magic spills out from a world beyond the veil, bringing with it creatures 
      devoted to ancient deities- beings who look on the burgeoning Venetian empire and smile at the madness unfolding.</p>

<p>The first steps into Carnevale are easiest with our two player starter set, available from many game stores and the TTCombat web-store. With this you have everything you need 
  to play your very first games of Carnevale.</p>

<p>Two complete playable gangs, one of The Guild and one of The Rashaar with the rules, dice, board and scenery you need to start your own narrative in the streets of Venice.</p>

<p>First of all you'll want to build the beautifully detailed miniatures that represent your gangs on the tabletop, as always since these are made from resin we suggest washing 
  them in warm, soapy water first and building them with a suitable glue (we recommend super glue for resin). To make this as easy as possible the miniatures in the 2 player 
  starter are all one piece miniatures. This means all you have to do is slot them into their bases, you can use glue to secure them if you wish, and you can play straight away.</p>

<p>To make your miniatures look their best on the tabletop we always recommend painting them with water based acrylic paint. Although with our many pieces of artwork we have 
  shown a consistent colour scheme for each miniature, please feel free to create your own to add your own influence on your gang. We also love to see fully painted miniatures 
  so once you're done please show us a picture on the Carnevale Facebook group.</p>

<p>Once your miniatures are built (painting is optional), you are ready to play Carnevale. The cardboard buildings are easily made to create your gaming area of Venice. 
  Read through the rules, have fun playing through the starter campaign and then you'll be ready to play the main scenarios presented in the rulebook.</p>

<p>After you've played with the starter gangs a few times you'll want to start growing your gang, giving yourself other options for your gang to take to the streets with. 
  Maybe you would like exploring one of the other factions of Venice. So many options are available, again from game stores and from the TTCombat web-store. Maybe you'll want 
  new buildings from our MDF range and boards to build real depths in the canals of Venice. Always remember though, the streets of Venice are no longer for the faint of heart,
   and as you become more immersed in the world of Carnevale, you might find yourself hungering for blood or even thirsting for magic.</p>
