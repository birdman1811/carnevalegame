<p>Venice, 1795
  A great catastrophe has engulfed the world. While civilisations fall and empires collapse, a single mote of brightness shines from the darkness.
  Serenissima, the Floating City, Queen of the Adriatic. In these benighted times the once-powerful state of  Venice returns to its pomp and glory. From across the globe traders, politicians and peasants alike are drawn to the City of Canals to make a fortune, or seek it. Rising from the waves that sunk most of Europe, the Venetians are poised once again to command the destiny of distant nations.
  Merchants work their deals by day while riotous masquerades resound from the palaces of the nobility. Visitors astound at the marvels of artisans that ply their wares from the canalsides and piazzas. Fishermen haul in their boats and the citizens go about their business with forced laughs and strained smiles.
  Because Venice is not as shining a jewel as it may first seem. Not unearned is its other title - the City of Masks.
  At night the baleful gleam of the Rent in the Sky defies any sleep. The music of the masqueratas grows loud and close as the celebrations take a sinister and bloody turn. Fleeing this depravity one might seek sanctuary in the quieter quarters. In darkened alleys the pad of a foot and scrape of metal on leather can signal quick demise. A tittering laugh or a fleeting shadow stalks the unwary, and here even the lap of the unquiet canal waters betrays an even deadlier threat.
  The canals run red.</p>
  <h2>This is Carnevale.</h2> 

  <img class = "capopic" src = "../../assets/images/Capodecime Balcony 2017-03-02.jpg">
  <p></p>

  
  
<h2>First Steps</h2>
<p>
  The first steps into Carnevale are best done with our two player starter set, avaialble from many game stores and the TTCombat webstore. With this you have everything you need to play
  your very first games of Carnevale.
</p>

<img class = "showimg" src = "../../assets/images/StarterBoxWeb.png">

<p> Two complete playable gangs, one of The Guild and one of The Rashaar with the rules, dice, board and scenery you need to start your own narrative in the streets of Venice. </p>

<p> First of all you'll want to build the beautifully detailed miniatures that represent your gangs, as always since these are made from resin we suggest washing them in warm, soapy
  water first and building them with a suitable glue. To make this as easy as possible the miniatures in the 2 player starter are all one piece miniature. This means all you have to do
  is slot them into their bases, you can use glue to secure them if you wish, and you can play straight away.
</p>

  <div class="grid-item">Slave 3 <img class = "charimg" src = "../../assets/images/characterimages/rashaar/Slave 1.png" ></div>
  
</div>

<p>To make your miniatures look their best on the tabletop we always recommend painting them with water based acrylic paint. Although with our many pieces of artwork we have shown a consistent
  colour scheme for each miniature, please feel free to create your own to add your own influence on your gang. We also love to see fully painted miniatures so once your done please show us a
  picture on the Carnevale Facebook group.
</p>

<p>Once your miniatures are built (painting is optional), you are ready to play Carnevale. The cardboard buildings are easily made to create your gaming area of Venice. Read through the rules, 
 have fun playing through the starter campaign and then you'll be ready to play the main scenarios presented in the rulebook. 
</p>

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>

    <p>Once you've played with the starter gangs a few times you'll want to start growing your gang, giving yourself other options for your gang to take to the streets with. Maybe
      you would like exploring one of the other factions of Venice.
      So many options are available, again from game stores and from the TTCombat webstore. Maybe you'll want new buildings from our MDF range and boards to build real depths in the canals of venice.
      Always remember though, the streets of Venice are no longer for the faint of heart, and as your time spent here grows, so will your hunger for violence, or for the sweet taste of magic.
