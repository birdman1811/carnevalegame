   <p>The Guild as it stands today has gone through many transformations, though its origins come from the old tradition of the shipbuilding Castellani family and the fishing 
       Nicolottis. The two warring families created the first guilds in Venice, groups that ostensibly would work together for 
       the benefit of their own workers, but realistically were only created to organise the fighting between the two families. The Guild is both of these groups and more,
        coming from destitution into power.</p>

        <p>The Guild</p>

        <p>Venice always had a number of guilds representing the various businesses of the city. As Venice struggled financially the Guilds lost their power and pull over the running of
            Venice eventually becoming nothing more than a collection of out of work, imporverished commoners. Eventually this lead to them turning towards the criminal underbelly of Venice.
            In little time the Thieves guild became the biggest and strongest guild of Venice. The Thieves guild had agents all over the city, therefore aware of all deals and every coming and
            going in the city. Muggings, extortion and smuggling became the de facto trade of the city, and the unemployed had found a home.
        </p>

        <p>
            Over time the Thieves guild made deals with the other guilds. First the brothels joined into an agreement. Since the brothels with their harlots and Gnaga were in prime position
            to discover the secrets of people around Venice this was a perfect fit. The Thieves would give money or provide protection for the brothels, in return, the brothels would give the Thieves
            secrets about their clientele. Wealthy aristocrats would visit a brothel, the Thieves guild would be informed, and while the aristocrat enjoys the company of the brothel, his case is robbed. 
            Or they lie in wait on the way to his home, waiting to pounce. Either way, his visit to said brothel is a lot more costly than he thought.</p>

            <p>Over time more and more guilds and organisations had deals with the Thieves guild. Most had to accept lowering their proud morals and standards in order to feed and clothe their loved ones. 
            By the time the rent appeared in the sky, the Thieves guild was simply known as The Guild, and had partnerships with dozens of different guilds, all now under one banner. </p>

            <p> Since the rent in the sky, due to the massive increase in trade, and the ruling classes apathy to the general citizenry, the Guilds membership has swelled significantly. Venice
                has become a dangerous place for the average citizen, the attacks from the patricians Masquerattas, the Vatican attacking the citizenry, the rumours of monsters from the canals and
                the Doctors night time tests, people look for protection, and the Guild are all too happy to provide it, for a fee. Once you've accepted the Guilds protection, it's a lifetime
                agreement, and there are expectations on the person gaining the Guilds protection. Many have been awoken in the night expected to shelter a wanted theif in hiding from the authorities. 
                Or had a knock on the door and been told to come and fight for the Guild, saying no is not an option. 

        </p>

        <p>As the threats in Venice grow more and more, the Guilds influence grows. It is said that you cannot walk down any alley in Venice without the King of Thieves knowing exactly when you walked down
            there, who you spoke to and what you were carrying. Nowadays the Guild don't go looking for alliances, people come to them and for the right price, they'll listen to anyone about an agreement.

        <p>The New Members</p>
        <p>“So you wish to join us do you?” A man cloaked in shadow asked calmly, his voice giving no sign of personality or interest. “Why should I allow you to join us? 
            What can you give to us in return for membership into the Guild?”</p>

<p>“Yes sir, we need the protection of the Guild. The Patrician guards have been overturning stalls and stealing our wares. Business is so bad right now that we may have 
    to sell shop and get out of town,” the butcher seethed, his voice full of hatred. Beside him other shopkeepers murmured in agreement, for each one felt that the guards
     - and by extension the Patricians - who were entrusted to look after the city had been negligent in their duty.   </p>

<p>The shadowy figure took a moment before he spoke, seemingly weighing up his options, “So you feel that those whom you trusted to protect you have abandoned you? You 
    feel like those in power have abused and taken you for granted? It is true that this city's nobility have fallen into their own hedonism and have discarded their 
    duties of running the city. Because of this, it has fallen to us to carry the slack; we, the Guild, now run this city. Through our membership you shall never have 
    to fear for your stalls again - your stock will never falter.”</p>

<p>After deliberating for a short while, the disgruntled group of shopkeepers each agreed to join, in turn pledging themselves to serve with utmost loyalty.</p>

<p>With a smirk the man finally revealed himself to the group. He wore a white overcoat with a long hood and a golden mask that concealed his face. A red cape draped his
     shoulders and a pair of swords hung either side of his waist. “There are three rules which you must uphold at all times if you are to be a true member of the Guild:
      the first is Omerta- which means ensuring complete secrecy, no matter the cost. This is the most important rule and failure to follow this will cost you your life. 
      The second is Fedelta- you will swear your allegiance to myself and the Guild. The final rule is Fraternita- all business orientated dealings must be authorised and
       sanctioned by the Guild.” </p>

<p>There was a slight murmur of concern but the man chose to ignore this and continue. “If you swear to uphold these three rules then I welcome you as comrades in arms. 
    Together we shall build a better Venice, one free of corruption from the so called nobility.” To show his respect, the man embraced each new member in turn. “It is a
     good day, but now we shall have to blood you as new recruits. We are attacking a focal point for the Patricians tonight: the <i>Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia</i> 
     in the Dorsuduro district. My contacts have told me that the art academy has many priceless pieces that are being sold and it would be a real shame if they went missing 
     before the auction.” The hooded man grinned in anticipation.</p>

          <p>The Guild have a lot of options. Powerful Command Abilities, very specialised Heroes alead by powerful leaders. The Henchmen can be fielded in a high number which makes up for 
              their individual weakness. The Black Lamps give them a strong defence against gangs utilising magic, while the Capodecinas hop through the rooftops, landing on the monsters threatening
              the citizens of Venice.
