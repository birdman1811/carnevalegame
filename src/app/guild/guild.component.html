   <p>The Guild as it stands today has gone through many transformations, though its origins come from the old tradition of the shipbuilding Castellani family and the fishing 
       Nicolottis. The two warring families created the first guilds in Venice, groups that ostensibly would work together for 
       the benefit of their own workers, but realistically were only created to organise the fighting between the two families. The Guild is both of these groups and more,
        coming from destitution into power.</p>

        <p>The Guild</p>

        <p>Venice always had a number of guilds representing the various businesses of the city. As Venice struggled financially the Guilds lost their power and pull over the running of
            Venice eventually becoming nothing more than a collection of out of work, imporverished commoners. Eventually this lead to them turning towards the criminal underbelly of Venice.
            In little time the Thieves guild became the biggest and strongest guild of Venice. The Thieves guild had agents all over the city, therefore aware of all deals and every coming and
            going in the city. Muggings, extortion and smuggling became the de facto trade of the city, and the unemployed had found a home.
        </p>

        <p>
            Over time the Thieves guild made deals with the other guilds. First the brothels joined into an agreement. Since the brothels with their harlots and Gnaga were in prime position
            to discover the secrets of people around Venice this was a perfect fit. The Thieves would give money or provide protection for the brothels, in return, the brothels would give the Thieves
            secrets about their clientele. Wealthy aristocrats would visit a brothel, the Thieves guild would be informed, and while the aristocrat enjoys the company of the brothel, his case is robbed. 
            Or they lie in wait on the way to his home, waiting to pounce. Either way, his visit to said brothel is a lot more costly than he thought.</p>

            <p>Over time more and more guilds and organisations had deals with the Thieves guild. Most had to accept lowering their proud morals and standards in order to feed and clothe their loved ones. 
            By the time the rent appeared in the sky, the Thieves guild was simply known as The Guild, and had partnerships with dozens of different guilds, all now under one banner. </p>

            <p> Since the rent in the sky, due to the massive increase in trade, and the ruling classes apathy to the general citizenry, the Guilds membership has swelled significantly. Venice
                has become a dangerous place for the average citizen, the attacks from the patricians Masquerattas, the Vatican attacking the citizenry, the rumours of monsters from the canals and
                the Doctors night time tests, people look for protection, and the Guild are all too happy to provide it, for a fee. Once you've accepted the Guilds protection, it's a lifetime
                agreement, and their are expectations on the person gaining the Guilds protection. Many have been awoken in the night expected to shelter a wanted theif in hiding from the authorities. 
                Or had a knock on the door and been told to come and fight for the Guild, saying no is not an option. 

        </p>

        <p>As the threats in Venice grow more and more, the Guilds influence grows. It is said that you cannot walk down any alley in Venice without the King of Thieves knowing exactly when you walked down
            there, who you spoke to and what you were carrying. Nowadays the Guild don;t go looking for alliances, people come to them and for the right price, they'll listen to anyone about an agreement.

          <p>The Guild have a lot of options. Powerful Command Abilities, very specialised Heroes alead by powerful leaders. The Henchmen can be fielded in a high number which makes up for 
              their individual weakness. The Black Lamps give them a strong defence against gangs utilising magic, while the Capodecinas hop through the rooftops, landing on the monsters threatening
              the citizens of Venice.
